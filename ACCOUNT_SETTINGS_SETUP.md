# Account Settings Implementation - Setup Guide

## Overview
Complete professional account settings system with backend-heavy logic to keep iOS app lightweight.

---

## üéØ What's Been Built

### Backend (Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL)
‚úÖ **Database Schema**
- `UserSettings` - All user preferences, notifications, privacy settings
- `BlockedUser` - User blocking functionality
- `AccountDeletionRequest` - 30-day grace period deletions
- `PasswordResetToken` - Secure password reset tokens
- `LoginHistory` - Track all login attempts

‚úÖ **API Endpoints** (`/account/*`)
- `GET /settings` - Fetch user settings
- `PATCH /settings` - Update any setting
- `POST /change-password` - Change password with validation
- `POST /request-password-reset` - Email password reset link
- `POST /reset-password` - Reset with token
- `POST /request-deletion` - Schedule account deletion (30 days)
- `POST /cancel-deletion` - Cancel pending deletion
- `DELETE /delete-now` - Immediate permanent deletion
- `POST /block-user` - Block a user
- `DELETE /unblock-user/:id` - Unblock user
- `GET /blocked-users` - List blocked users
- `GET /login-history` - View login history
- `POST /export-data` - GDPR data export

### iOS (SwiftUI)
‚úÖ **Service Layer**
- `AccountSettingsService` - All API communication
- Lightweight, backend does heavy lifting
- Published state for reactive UI

‚úÖ **Views**
- `AccountSettingsView` - Main settings screen with all sections
- `ChangePasswordView` - Password change with strength indicator
- `DeleteAccountView` - Two deletion options (grace period vs immediate)
- `BlockedUsersView` - Manage blocked users
- `LoginHistoryView` - Security monitoring
- `PrivacyPolicyView` - Complete privacy policy
- `TermsOfServiceView` - Terms of service

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd /Users/joshtewksbury/Desktop/FINAL/VibeBackend

# Generate Prisma client with new schema
npx prisma generate

# Create and run migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_account_settings

# Or for production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend

```bash
# Your backend is already configured in server.ts
# Just deploy to Railway

railway up

# Or if using existing deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Add account settings endpoints"
git push railway main
```

### Step 3: iOS Integration

The iOS files are ready to use. Just add them to your Xcode project:

**Files Created:**
- `Features/Settings/Services/AccountSettingsService.swift`
- `Features/Settings/Views/AccountSettingsView.swift`
- `Features/Settings/Views/ChangePasswordView.swift`
- `Features/Settings/Views/DeleteAccountView.swift`
- `Features/Settings/Views/BlockedUsersView.swift`
- `Features/Settings/Views/LoginHistoryView.swift`
- `Features/Settings/Views/PrivacyPolicyView.swift`
- `Features/Settings/Views/TermsOfServiceView.swift`

**To add to existing profile:**

In your `ProfilePageView.swift`, add a settings button:

```swift
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
        NavigationLink {
            AccountSettingsView()
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "gearshape.fill")
        }
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Test Change Password
```bash
# Login first to get token
curl -X POST https://your-backend.railway.app/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@vibe.com","password":"password"}'

# Change password
curl -X POST https://your-backend.railway.app/account/change-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"currentPassword":"password","newPassword":"newpassword123"}'
```

### Test Settings Update
```bash
curl -X PATCH https://your-backend.railway.app/account/settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"pushNotificationsEnabled":false,"darkModeEnabled":true}'
```

### Test Block User
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend.railway.app/account/block-user \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"blockedUserId":"USER_ID","reason":"Spam"}'
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Migration fails
**Solution:** Check PostgreSQL connection, ensure no typos in schema

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Solution:** Verify JWT token in Authorization header

### Issue: Settings not loading
**Solution:** Settings auto-created on first access. Check network logs.

### Issue: Password reset email not sent
**Solution:** Email sending not implemented yet. See TODO in code.
